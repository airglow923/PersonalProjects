# Personal Projects
These entire programming projects are based on <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/">Robert Heaton</a>'s ideas.

All projects are done in C++ and tap on APIs such as ImageMagick for image processing, OpenCV for using webcam, and cURL for web scraping.
